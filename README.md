The demo page can be found here: [https://flimflamjs.github.io/7GUIs/](https://flimflamjs.github.io/7GUIs/)

Flimflam is a pattern for creating GUIs using functional programming.

Each directory here constitutes a single 7GUIs example. Each example has a set of tests that can be found each each directory's `test/index.js` file. Each test directory also has its own README.md file with further details.
