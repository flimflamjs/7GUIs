# 7GUIs Counter Component

> Challenges: understanding the basic ideas of a language/toolkit and the essential scaffolding

> Counter serves as a gentle introduction to the basics of the language, paradigm and toolkit for one of the simplest GUI applications. Thus, by comparing Counter implementations one can clearly see what basic scaffolding is needed and how the very basic features work together to build a GUI application. A good solution will have very minimal scaffolding.
